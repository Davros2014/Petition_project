# Petition project

#### An online petition where supporters of a given cause can register, log-in, add basic profile information and have the option to update their profile information, sign/re-sign the petition, and then view a list of fellow supporters (sorted by location).

#### The theme is based around a current bugbear: Brexit. Or rather, the word itself, as we appear to be on a collision course insofar as the actual act itself is concerned, my petition concerns itself with the removal of the word from the Oxford English dictionary. All for fun, you laugh or you'd have to cry really...

#### _Technologies used:_ Handlebars, Node.js, Express.js, jQuery, SCSS & PostgreSQL
